## What is a Password Generator? 

- The purpose of a password generator is to create a new strong and unique password everytime you need to periodically 
change your current password due to sensitive data at work or if your account ever gets hacked. 

## How does the Password Generator create a password?

- When you go to press the generate button it will ask you a series of questions.
- It asks for how many characters you want in your password. The bigger the password the more secure they tend to be. 
- It will ask you if you want to include special characters, numbers, Uppercase and lowercase letters.
- A good practice would be to include as many different characters in your password as possible to make it more secure.
